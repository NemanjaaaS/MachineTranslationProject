Changed and additional tasks needed to be production ready:

Testing:
Upload code on test environment, check the performance and do end-to-end testing to 
ensure that everything works as expected in simulated production environment.

Security:
Securing API endpoints.
Make sure that only autorized users can access the system.

We should make sure that Machine Translation Service API is always available and
make changes for what to do if it is not. (Make some default values, handle errors...)

Documentation:
I would use Springdoc OpenAPI for API documentation.
We should include detailed instructions for developers and users.

Monitoring:
Implement tools for monitoring application performance.
